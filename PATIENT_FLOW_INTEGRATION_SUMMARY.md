## Changes Made

### 1. Patient Flow Forecast Integration

- **File**: `VIEW/HTML/Dashboard.html`
- **Action**: Replaced the placeholder Patient Flow Forecast section with complete functionality from the original PatientFlowFcst.html
- **Content Added**:
  - Controls section with forecast period, service type filter, and confidence level selectors
  - Service chips for quick filtering
  - Key metrics cards (Total Predicted Visits, Daily Average, Peak Day, Data Reliability)
  - Main forecast chart container
  - Service distribution breakdown
  - 7-day detailed forecast table
  - Staffing recommendations alert section

### 2. Sidebar Navigation Updates

- **Script**: `update_all_modules_sidebar.ps1`
- **Status**: All files already updated from previous runs

### 3. NaN Issues Fixed

#### Landing Page JavaScript (`VIEW/JAVASCRIPT/Landingpage.js`)

- **Issue**: `parseInt()` could return NaN when counter text contains no numbers
- **Fix**: Added `|| 0` fallback and validation check for target > 0
- **Lines**: 255-275

#### Dashboard JavaScript (`VIEW/JAVASCRIPT/Dashboard.js`)

- **Issue**: Date validation could fail with NaN values

- **Lines**: 183-184

#### Seasonality Explorer JavaScript (`VIEW/JAVASCRIPT/SeasonalityExplorer.js`)

- **Issue**: `parseInt(visits)` could return NaN
- **Fix**: Added `|| 0` fallback for visit number parsing
- **Line**: 144

#### Logs and Audit Trail JavaScript (`VIEW/SERVICES/servicesjs/LogsAndAuditTrail.js`)

- **Issue**: Clear period parsing could return NaN
- **Fix**: Added `|| 30` fallback (default to 30 days) and better variable naming
- **Line**: 488

#### Events & Seminar JavaScript (`VIEW/SERVICES/servicesjs/Events&Seminar.js`)

- **Issue**: Time parsing could result in NaN hours/minutes
- **Fix**: Added `|| 0` fallbacks for both hours and minutes parsing
- **Lines**: 656
